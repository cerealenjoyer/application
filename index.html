            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hello world! I'm Sasha. I'm an English Literature graduate, 29,
              who has found herself writing fundraising materials for an
              international development charity. I'm happy that I'm able to use
              the writing skills I developed at university in my job, but am
              ready to try something new.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to Febuary of this year I had absolutely no experience
              coding. I was always very good at maths and English, and
              significantly less good at art and design - that's why for my F&C
              application I decided to turn the CSS aspect of my website into a
              challenge - rather than spend a long time trying to figure out
              what my website should look like, I tried to replicate the look of
              the first computer I ever used - my Grandpa's Windows 98.
            </p>
            <p>
              Computers and technology have always been of interest to me, both
              from a purely surface-level perspective (they're fun to play
              around with) but also because of the more theoretical questions
              that they raise in regards to gender and identity. The internet is
              for many queer people of my generation a formative space to
              explore gender and expression; you can 'try out' an alternate
              gender presentation or sexuality in a virtual space without fear of real-life
              backlash. However, as with other marginalised groups, tech can be
              used to make the lives of LGBT people more difficult that speak
              to a culture of privilege within the industry. Web forms are
              frequently guilty of asking poorly worded questions around gender,or make assumptions about sexuality. 
              The most egregious example of this I've seen was an energy provider, who could only make a joint account
              for two people if they were a straight couple - They once sent out a letter to my downstairs neighbours (both men)
              addressed to Mr and Mrs Mr Smith
            </p>
            <p>
              I was the first openly LGBT person at my current workplace, and I
              went back and forth with HR for a while because they couldn't
              understand that it wasn't appropriate for my sexuality to be displayed in my intranet profile.
              They didn't mean
              anything by it, they just hadn't considered what my user
              experience might be: That's why I feel so strongly about diversity
              in tech, because it doesn't just affect people who work in the
              tech industry, but people from all walks of life who use
              technology on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              I first became aware of Founders and Coders through one of my
              friends, who I'd previously worked with until she quit to join one
              of your cohorts in 2018. When she told me about your intention to
              widen the presence of underrepresented groups in tech I knew it
              was something I wanted to be a part of. I'm a huge fan of how
              committed F&C is to upholding the use of inclusive language, which
              I've seen on the Discord (and the Slack before that) both from the
              Discord bot and the FAC team. I've found the Tuesday and Thursday
              coaching groups an absolute delight, specifically they've turned
              DOM manipulation from a total enigma to something manageable.

            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a huge fan of making things with my hands and I'm extremely
              reluctant to spend money. Most of my hobbies are reflective of
              this. I've been baking sourdough more or less daily since 2018,
              and in 2019 I began making my own soap, and I started brewing beer
              in 2020 using locally sourced ingredients. I find the amount of
              packaging that all of these products come in to be totally
              ridiculous, and much of the hobby industry is similarly wasteful,
              so I learned wherever possible to use unprocessed ingredients
              rather than (for example) a pre-assembled beermaking kit.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like to think of this website as having a similar ethic, apart
              from the classic windows 98 icons I've tried to make everything
              using CSS, so I can take full credit for the page, limitations and
              all.
