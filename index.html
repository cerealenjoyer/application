              Hello world! I'm Sasha. I'm an English Literature graduate, 29,
              who has found herself writing fundraising materials for an
              international development charity. I'm happy that I'm able to use
              the writing skills I developed at university in my job, but am
              ready to try something new.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to Febuary of this year I had absolutely no experience
              coding. I was always very good at maths and English, and
              significantly less good at art and design - that's why for my F&C
              application I decided to turn the CSS aspect of my website into a
              challenge - rather than spend a long time trying to figure out
              what my website should look like, I tried to replicate the look of
              the first computer I ever used - my Grandpa's Windows 98.
            </p>
            <p>
              I first became aware of Founders and Coders through one of my
              friends, who I'd previously worked with until she quit to join one
              of your cohorts in 2018. When she told me about your intention to
              widen the presence of underrepresented groups in tech I knew I
              owed it to myself to apply; I had volunteered for an LGBT charity
              at uni, but found myself having to move back into the closet at
              work. Worse, I encountered workplaces where homophobia and
              transphobia were passively tolerated in the office but any
              resistance or pushback was viewed as wholly inappropriate. I'm a
              huge fan of how committed F&C is to upholding the use of inclusive
              language, which I've seen on the Discord both from the Discord bot
              and the FAC team.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm a huge fan of making things with my hands and I'm extremely
              reluctant to spend money. Most of my hobbies are reflective of
              this. I've been baking sourdough more or less daily since 2018,
              and in 2019 I began making my own soap, and I started brewing beer
              in 2020 using locally sourced ingredients. I find the amount of
              packaging that all of these products come in to be totally
              ridiculous, and much of the hobby industry is similarly wasteful,
              so I learned wherever possible to use unprocessed ingredients
              rather than (for example) a pre-assembled beermaking kit.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like to think of this website as having a similar ethic, apart
              from the classic windows 98 icons I've tried to make everything
              using CSS, so I can take full credit for the page, limitations and
              all.
