<h2> Liner notes and fun facts <h2>
  <ul>
<li> I mostly used my grandpa's computer to play old shovelware games, but once I opened an Encarta CD and thought that I'd got on the internet somehow. I was worried that he was going to see the huge phone bill from going on the internet and sue me for the money (a million pounds). Ah, to be 25 again.</li>
 <li> I thought about bringing up Wendy Carlos, the transgender electronic musician who helped develop the Moog synthesiser in my paragraph about gender and technology, but honestly I don't know a lot about electronic music and didn't want to be caught out if one of you is a superfan</li>
  <li> My breadmaking and beer-brewing hobbies are currently on hiatus because the yeast cultures I use for each project got cross contaminated and both died. RIP to both cultures, there are two more stars in the sky tonight </li>
